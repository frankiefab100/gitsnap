GitSnap is a browser extension that transforms your GitHub repository data into visually engaging charts.

It utilize the [Echarts library](https://echarts.apache.org/) to create various types of charts (such as line chart, pie chart, bar chart) for visualizing GitHub repository key metrics such as contributors' activity, branches, pull request, and issue statistics.


## Features

- **Contributors Metrics**: See who is contributing to your project with detailed insights into distribution of contributions as well as key contributors.
- **Pull Request Analytics**: Monitor the status (open, merged, and closed) of pull requests over time.
- **Issue Tracking**: Track issues with line charts that display both open and closed issues over time.
- **Branch Visualization**: View branches as a tree structure, to understand the relationships and hierarchy between different branches in your repository.
